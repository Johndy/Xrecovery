Xrecovery can create a bootable system from either a Recovery HD partition or an
OS X installer downloaded from the App Store.

When running Xrecovery, simply follow the guided setup. Compatible "source"
systems will be automatically detected and presented as options. Partitions
which are large enough to contain the new recovery system will then be presented
to choose from to contain the new recovery system.
